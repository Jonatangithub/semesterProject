1. Middleware Development:
The functionality of the middleware is to save data to a .json file
any time I make a change to the users. I am aware this is NOT how I 
should store user info long term, its just some temporary logic. It 
will be stored in a database in the future, so it is still wip.

The design is suppose to be so universal that i can edit, delete
and add users with the same logic. I will keep the logic of the 
middleware for later use, but the outcome will change from json to 
database.

2. The plan behind implementing the saveuserstofile is to have a 
middleware that has purpose in the later state of the website, 
without having to refine it and completing it right now. The 
future plan is to update, upgrade and implement it to the database
for usage to update statistics and such.

The middleware is integrated in its own file; USERLOGIC.MJS. it 
is kind of an "extension" of the usersRoute.mjs. In retrospective
i would make a middleware with a little more usage potensial and
a little more futureproof.

The middleware is mainly the saveuserstofile function used in 
UsersRoute.mjs, it can be spotted in most of th API's. 
chechIfUserExits is also a middleware function. Intended to be used
in USER.API.post.
